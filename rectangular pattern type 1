Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a square pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a square pattern with the help of *  such that each * is space-separated in each line.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 3
Output:
* * *
* * *
* * *




class Solution {

    void printSquare(int n) {
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
           for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
           System.out.print("* ");
           }
           System.out.println("");
       }
    }
}
