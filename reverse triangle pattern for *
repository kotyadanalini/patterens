Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek build a star pattern.

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output:
* * * * *
* * * * 
* * * 
* *  
* 
class Solution {

    void printTriangle(int n) {
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<=n-i;j++){
                System.out.print("* ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
