Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a pattern of triangle to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a triangle pattern using stars(*).

 

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
Output:
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * *





class Solution {

    void printTriangle(int n) {
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
           for(int j=0;j<=i;j++){
               System.out.print("* ");
           }
           System.out.println();
       }
    }
}
