Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a  pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a pattern.

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output:
1
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5

public class Solution {
    public static void nTriangle(int n) {
       for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<=i;j++){
                System.out.print(j+" ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
